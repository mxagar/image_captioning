# Image Captioning Project

This repository contains an image captioning project with deep learning. Given an image, first, it is processed by a CNN, and second, by a RNN. The model outputs a text caption of the content. The COCO dataset was used for training.

The project uses materials from the [Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891).
