# Image Captioning Project

This repository contains an image captioning project with deep learning. Given an image, first, it is processed by a CNN, and second, by a RNN. The model outputs a text caption of the content. The COCO dataset was used for training.

The project uses materials from the [Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891).

### Dependencies

You should create a python environment (e.g., with [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)) and install the dependencies listed in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.

A short summary of commands required to have all in place is the following:

```bash
conda create -n img-capt python=3.6
